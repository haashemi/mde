# MDE

[MDE](https://mde.haashemi.dev) is a simple web-based markdown editor with the features that you actually need.

## Remark/Rehype Plugins

MDE is using a few plugins to make it more functional and useful until adding the plugin toggle menu. These plugins are:

- _Remark plugins_:
  - `remark-gemoji`
  - `remark-gfm`
- _Rehype plugins_:
  - `rehype-autolink-headings`
  - `rehype-slug`

## Roadmap

_These are not in any particular order._

- Implement a fully functional PWA
- Implement a better editor section (e.g., Syntax Highlight)
- Update the scrollbar of the panels
- Implement a full-screen menu
  - Implement remark/rehype plugin toggle menu
  - ~~Implement a reset button~~
  - Implement a capture preview button
  - Implement a recent documents menu
